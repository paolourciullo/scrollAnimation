This project is a JavaScript module that shows additional content blocks as the user scrolls down the page.  This module is a good example of how to use CSS and JS to change the status of the content from being off the page to being slid on at the bottom.  All work is from a tutorial by Brad Traversy on Udemy.    

## Installation

The link to the finished project can be found here: [Scroll Animation](https://paolourciullo.github.io/scrollAnimation/) .



## Usage
